# Batman Villain Gifs

This project deals with API's. There are previously generated buttons, and there is an option to create new buttons. When clicked on, each button will go to giffy's API and return with a large object which the code sorts through and pulls wanted gifs from. Then, 10 gifs will be visible to the user, in still state. Once clicked, each gif will play, and stop if clicked again.
